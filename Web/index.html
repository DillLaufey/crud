        <h2>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h2>
        <p>
          The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and
          shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by
          Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in
          American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also
          includes television series, short films, digital series, and
          literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel
          Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot
          elements, settings, cast, and characters. Marvel Studios releases its
          films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases
          collectively known as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three
          phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008),
          began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The
          Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with
          Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War
          (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four
          began with Black Widow (2021) and will conclude with Black Panther:
          Wakanda Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) will
          begin Phase Five, which will end with Thunderbolts (2024), and Phase
          Six begins with Deadpool 3 (2024). Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga"
          will conclude with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2025) and Avengers:
          Secret Wars (2025). Marvel Television expanded the universe to network
          television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before further
          expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable
          television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series Agents
          of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own
          television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision
          in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. The MCU also includes tie-in
          comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short
          films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral marketing campaigns for the
          films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront and The Daily
          Bugle. The franchise has been commercially successful and generally
          received positive reviews. It has inspired other film and television
          studios to attempt similar shared universes, and has also inspired
          several themed attractions, an art exhibit, television specials,
          guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and
          commercials.
